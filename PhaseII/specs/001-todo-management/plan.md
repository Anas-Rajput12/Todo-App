# Implementation Plan: Todo Management Console Application

**Branch**: `001-todo-management` | **Date**: 2026-01-05 | **Spec**: C:/Users/HAJI LAPTOP g55/Desktop/Todo_app/specs/001-todo-management/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-todo-management/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implementation of a console-based todo management application that allows users to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete. The application follows a simple architecture with three main components: Task Model, Task Manager, and CLI Interface. The system stores tasks in memory only with no persistence, following the simplicity-first principle.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+ (as required by constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**: Standard Python libraries only, no external frameworks
**Storage**: In-memory using Python lists and dictionaries (no persistence)
**Testing**: pytest for unit and integration testing
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform console application (Windows, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single console application - determines source structure
**Performance Goals**: <2 seconds response time for all operations (as specified in success criteria)
**Constraints**: <100MB memory usage, console-based only, single-user application
**Scale/Scope**: Single user, local application with no network requirements

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- ✅ Spec-Driven Development: Following strict Spec-Driven Development with complete spec before implementation
- ✅ Simplicity First: Using in-memory storage only, no persistence, clean Python code
- ✅ Deterministic Behavior: Functions will have single responsibility, predictable input/output
- ✅ Explicit Task Management: Using incremental integer IDs for all tasks
- ✅ No Manual Coding: All implementation will be generated by Claude Code
- ✅ Python 3.13+ Requirement: Using Python 3.13+ as required
- ✅ Console-based: No GUI components, CLI interface only
- ✅ No external databases: Using in-memory Python data structures only
- ✅ Code organization: All code organized under /src directory
- ✅ Clear CLI prompts: Implementation will include clear user feedback
- ✅ Graceful error handling: Invalid inputs will be handled gracefully

```

**Structure Decision**: Single project structure chosen to match the simple console application requirements. The architecture follows the three-component design specified in the user input: Task Model (models.py), Task Manager (task_manager.py), and CLI Interface (main.py).
