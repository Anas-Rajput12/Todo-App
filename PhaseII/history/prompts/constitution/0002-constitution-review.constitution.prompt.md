## Prompt

# Phase II Constitution — Todo Full Stack App

## Core Principles
1. Spec-Driven Development ONLY
2. No manual code writing
3. Every feature must have:
   - Spec
   - Plan
   - Tasks
   - Implementation
4. Security first (JWT + user isolation)
5. UI must be responsive, accessible, and modern

## Non-Negotiables
- JWT required on all API calls
- Users only see their own tasks
- Mobile-first responsive UI
- Clean, readable code generated by Claude

## Success Criteria
- All Phase II features implemented
- App deployed on Vercel
- API deployed & working
- UI demo impresses judges in <90 seconds

## Response snapshot

I reviewed the existing constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md and found that it already contains all the principles and requirements you specified. The current constitution (version 2.0.0) includes:

1. Spec-Driven Development ONLY
2. Security first (JWT + user isolation)
3. No manual code writing
4. Full stack architecture requirements
5. Production ready requirements

And it also includes the non-negotiables you mentioned:
- JWT required on all API calls
- Users only see their own tasks
- Mobile-first responsive UI
- Clean, readable code

The constitution is already aligned with your requirements and appears to be up-to-date for Phase II development.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Verified that the existing constitution already aligns with all specified Phase II requirements
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for this review
- 📁 Files: Confirmed .specify/memory/constitution.md is properly configured
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with Phase II development using existing constitution
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution is well-structured for Phase II Todo Full Stack App development

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - constitution is properly configured
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All requirements verified
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard constitution review
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Begin Phase II feature development following the established constitution
