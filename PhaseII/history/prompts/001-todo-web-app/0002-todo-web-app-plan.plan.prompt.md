## Prompt

# Phase II Execution Plan

1. Setup monorepo with Spec-Kit
2. Define database schema
3. Build JWT-secured FastAPI backend
4. Implement REST API endpoints
5. Build Next.js frontend
6. Connect frontend → backend with JWT
7. Apply responsive UI & polish
8. Test acceptance criteria
9. Prepare demo flow

## Response snapshot

Completed the implementation planning for the Todo Web App feature. Created a comprehensive plan that includes:

1. Technical Context: Defined the technology stack (Python 3.13+, TypeScript 5.x, FastAPI, SQLModel, Next.js 16, Better Auth, Tailwind CSS, Neon PostgreSQL)

2. Constitution Check: Verified that all constitution requirements are satisfied:
   - Spec-Driven Development: Spec complete
   - Security First: JWT authentication and user isolation
   - Full Stack Architecture: FastAPI backend + Next.js 16 frontend + SQLModel database
   - No Manual Code Writing: All code to be generated by Claude Code
   - Production Ready: Deployed on Vercel with working API

3. Project Structure: Defined the dual-project structure with separate backend and frontend applications

4. Research Summary: Completed research on tech stack selection, authentication, database schema, API architecture, and security implementation

5. Data Model: Defined User and Task entities with fields, relationships, validation rules, and state transitions

6. API Contracts: Created OpenAPI 3.0 specification for all endpoints including authentication and task management

7. Quickstart Guide: Provided comprehensive setup and development workflow documentation

8. Agent Context: Updated the Claude Code context with new technologies for the project

All Phase 1 deliverables completed successfully with all constitution requirements validated.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created complete implementation plan aligned with constitution and spec requirements
- 🧪 Tests: No tests required for planning phase
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and openapi.yaml in specs/001-todo-web-app/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready to proceed with task generation using /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan comprehensively covers all aspects of the Todo Web App implementation

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None - all planning artifacts completed successfully
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS - All constitution requirements validated
- Prompt variant (if applicable): Standard planning workflow execution
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Proceed to task generation phase with /sp.tasks
