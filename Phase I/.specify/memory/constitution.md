# Todo Console Application Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Spec-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Follow strict Spec-Driven Development: no code before specification is complete and approved. All implementation must be generated by Claude Code. This ensures that every feature is well-defined and traceable before implementation begins.

### II. Simplicity First
In-memory data only, no persistence. Clean, readable, beginner-friendly Python code. This principle ensures that the application remains simple and focused on its core functionality without unnecessary complexity.

### III. Deterministic Behavior
Same input always produces same output. Single responsibility per function. This ensures predictable and testable behavior of the application, making it easier to debug and maintain.

### IV. Explicit Task Management
Explicit task IDs required for all operations. Consistent task ID generation. This ensures that every task in the system can be uniquely identified and managed throughout its lifecycle.

### V. No Manual Coding
All implementation must be generated by Claude Code. This enforces consistency and ensures that all code follows the established patterns and principles.

## Constraints and Quality Standards

### Python and Console Requirements
- Python 3.13+ required for all implementations
- Console-based interaction only, no GUI components
- No external databases, APIs, or frameworks
- Tasks stored in memory using Python data structures
- Every feature must trace back to a spec and task

### Quality Standards
- Clear CLI prompts and user feedback
- Graceful handling of invalid input
- Code organized under /src directory
- Clean, readable, beginner-friendly Python code

## Development Workflow

### Implementation Process
- Follow strict Spec-Driven Development: no code before specification is complete and approved
- All implementation must be generated by Claude Code
- Every feature must trace back to a spec and task
- Code organized under /src directory
- Clear CLI prompts and user feedback

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All implementations must comply with these principles. Amendments require explicit documentation, approval, and migration plan if applicable. All development work must verify compliance with these principles. Code must be organized under /src directory with clear CLI interface and graceful error handling.
